# _Models_Classification
Classification models : KNN , Decision Tree , Random Forest
This repository contains code for training and evaluating three classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These models are applied to a dataset for classification tasks.

# Data: 
The dataset used for this project is stored in Classified_Data.csv. The data is fake and created from a real dataset.

# Usage
 ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its nature.
 ### Data Wrangling:
Checking for data inconsistencies or issues.
 ### Data Preprocessing: 
Preparing the data for model training.
1. Scaling Features: Standardizing features to ensure uniformity.
2. Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset for training and testing.

# KNN Model
1. Creating KNN Model
2. Evaluating KNN Model
## Finding the Best K
 1. Elbow Method:
 2. Evaluating
 3. Diagram drawing

# Decision Tree Model
1. Creating Decision Tree Model
2. Evaluating Decision Tree Model

# Random Forest Model
1. Creating Random Forest Model
2. Evaluating Random Forest Model

# Model Comparison
After training and evaluating the models, choose the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to your specific dataset and requirements.

 Happy coding!
